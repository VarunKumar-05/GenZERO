This is a professional, high-impact README.md designed for your GitHub repository. It highlights the sophisticated neuro-architectural approach and the specific technical strengths of GenZERO.🧠 GenZERO: A Tri-Modular Neuro-Architectural FrameworkSolving High-Dimensional Temporal Alignment in Adolescent Mental HealthGenZERO is a cutting-edge AI framework designed to predict and monitor adolescent mental health indicators by fusing Event-Driven Spiking Dynamics with Gradient Boosted Decision Manifolds. Built for the Pathway GenAI Hackathon 2025, it addresses the "Black Box" problem in clinical AI through monosemantic feature disentanglement.📺 Project PresentationWatch our full technical walkthrough and demo on YouTube:GenZERO: Multi-Modal Neuro-Behavioral AI🚀 The Tri-Modular CoreGenZERO operates through three distinct, specialized layers:1. The BDH Spiking Graph Transformer (The "Synaptic Processor")Based on the Pathway BDH (Biological Dynamic Hebbian) architecture, this module processes 5Hz actigraphy streams.The Y-Factor: Implements Online Hebbian Learning. Synaptic weights ($\sigma$) update during the inference pass without requiring backpropagation.The WOW-Factor: Temporal Compression. It reduces 30 days of continuous accelerometer data into a static "Synaptic Memory Fingerprint" while preserving behavioral "burstiness."2. The Neural Sparse Autoencoder (The "Semantic Filter")Bridges the gap between raw neural dynamics and clinical decision-making.The Y-Factor: A non-linear dimensionality bottleneck that disentangles 4,096-dimensional matrices into 15 monosemantic features.The WOW-Factor: Auditability. Each feature maps to a specific phenotype (e.g., Kinetic Fatigue), allowing clinicians to see why a model made a prediction.3. The Ensemble Hybrid Booster (The "Decision Manifold")A multi-head ensemble (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost) augmented by a Synaptic-KNN Imputer.The Y-Factor: Uses Weighted Rank-Average Ensembling to stabilize clinical variance.The WOW-Factor: Physical Context. The model interprets movement patterns rather than just raw tabular scores.📊 Performance MetricsComponentMetricJudicial AssessmentInitial Hybrid BaselineTraining MSE: ~0.71Strong initial signal; potential for overfitting.Sparse Autoencoder (SAE)Reconstruction Loss: <0.001Exceptional capture of latent movement archetypes.Final Refined HybridTraining MSE: ~0.91Realistic and robust; handles missing data via Synaptic-KNN.Primary MetricQWK (Quad. Weighted Kappa)Aligned with Child Mind Institute standards for ordinal error.🧬 Mathematical FoundationsWe quantify Synaptic Evolution using the localized Hebbian rule:$$W_{t+1} = (1 - \lambda)W_t + \eta(x_t \otimes x_t)$$To penalize clinical misclassification, we optimize for Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK):$$\text{QWK} = 1 - \frac{\sum w_{i,j} O_{i,j}}{\sum w_{i,j} E_{i,j}}$$🛠️ Dataset SpecificationsActigraphy Stream: 5-Channel Vector $[X, Y, Z, \text{enmo}, \text{anglez}]$ at 5.0 Hz.Clinical Tabular Data: PCIAT totals, BMI, FitnessGram scores, and sleep disturbance scales.Synaptic Priors: Age-gated partitioning (Child, Pre-Teen, Teen) to account for neuro-developmental variance.📚 Scientific ValidationPathway Research (2024): Biological Dynamic Hebbian (BDH) Learning for Real-Time Streaming - Validates $O(T)$ linear efficiency.Bricken et al.
